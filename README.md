# Pong Game in Godot

This is a simple Pong game implemented in Godot. The game features two paddles and a ball, where players can control one paddle to hit the ball back and forth. The objective is to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The
AI player is controlled by a simple AI that moves the paddle up and down to intercept the ball.

I wrote this game as a fun project to learn more about Godot and game development *live* on Twitch at https://twitch.tv/saebyn.
The code is written in GDScript, which is the scripting language used in Godot.
